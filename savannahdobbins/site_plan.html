      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        Savannah Dobbins is a digital photographer and graphic design student based in Tulsa, Oklahoma. She has seven years of photography experience. Savannah currently studies graphic design at BYU-Idaho through its online program and is working towards her Bachelor&#39;s degree. <br>

        Savannah&#39;s work focuses on both natural and urban settings. She feels a close connection to the environment that surrounds her and her goal is to capture its true atmosphere. She has an obsession with light and shadow and finds both to to be incredibly powerful and communicative tools. In her work, she draws on them to bring attention to specific details, to conjure up feelings of peace, wonder, or appreciation in the viewer, and to present the atmosphere of a subject in photographic form. Naturally, she believes shadow is equally as powerful. <br>
