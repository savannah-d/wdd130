    <h2>Savannah Dobbins</h2>
    <p>My name is Savannah Dobbins and I live in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Before moving here, I moved around Nevada and Arizona a bit. I spent the first 14 years of my life in the Chicago area, though. </p>
    <p>I spend any free time I have reading, cooking, hiking, or thrifting. I also own my dogsitting business and I really enjoy it! I'm an art major with an emphasis in graphic design, but I also enjoy learning about computer programming, space events, and photography.</p>
    <p>I am looking at minoring in web development and thought I'd take this class before committing. Once I lock in my Associate's here at BYU-I, I hope to transfer somewhere closer to the Midwest and continue my education there.</p>
